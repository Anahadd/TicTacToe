# Tic Tac Toe 

## Project Overview 
#### This project was developed in the earlier stages of my Python pursuit. I used an algorithm called "Min-Max" in order to create an unbeatable AI. 

## How does it work? 
#### The Min-Max algorithm is a decision-making strategy implemented in two-person games to identify the most effective move for a player while considering 
the best potential response from the opponent. It works through the creation of a game tree, with each node representing a possible game state as a result 
of different plays. It awards scores to endpoint stages based on outcomes either victories, losses, or draws. It then examines these states continually, 
transitioning between a maximizing and a minimizing player who look for for the best and lowest scores, respectively. The method uses backpropagation to 
modify parent node ratings contingent on the examined scores of the children of those nodes. It subsequently chooses the move that results in the highest 
score for the current player and the lowest score for the opponent.
